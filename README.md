# Face recognition
This is a an example of face recognition and subsequent blurring done as a case study for Lumoview. 

The small_working_example is only for dockerhub test purposes.

face_recognition is my Face blurring algorithm using OpenCV.
Here is the docker image allowing to run the code: https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/nasuyo/dct

face_recognition_user_input is the same with the added possibility to manually blur more faces. This does not run in the docker container though.
